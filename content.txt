Why Michael the Home Buyer?
We understand that the traditional real estate market doesn’t fit everyone’s needs or timeline. It tends to alienate sellers with homes that need repairs or updates, and not everyone can wait with their house on the market for months at a time.
As a trailblazer in the cash home-buying industry, we want to help solve sellers’ problems with a fast and easy way to sell their houses without the typical hassles and stress. We strive to give our customers a different experience by putting the seller first, not the transaction.
What is Micheal the Home Buyer's history?
We buy ugly homes so that sellers can enjoy both the time they save and the convenience of us purchasing their house "as is" for cash. Since 2014, we’ve purchased over 2,500 houses the same way—in person. You say, "Buy my house fast," and we visit your house personally, can make you an all-cash offer on the spot, and then close quickly. It’s that easy.

What is our commitment ?
Michael the Home Buyer®️ takes a personalized approach to buying and isn’t your average home-buying company. We buy houses fast for cash and ensure that the customer understands the process every step of the way. We aren’t like other cash buyers who focus on doing business only online. We visit each house in person to get to know our customers and their houses before we give a free, fair cash offer. We’re cash home buyers who prefer to show up in person to answer questions and walk sellers through the process.
How many homes has Michael the Home Buyer bought over the years?
Since 2014 we have purchased hundreds of homes in the Province of Ontario We are not an outside agency that swoops in to buy up homes.
What do you need to know in order to buy my house?
We can get started with just some basic information about your house. How many bedrooms? How many bathrooms? Is there a garage? Is the basement finished? What is the overall condition of the property?
Can you really buy my house in just one week?
If all the paperwork is completed promptly, you have clear title and there are no problems, we can often complete the purchase of a property in just 7 days. Our fastest ever close was done in less than 24 hours.
Is there a fee you charge when you buy a house?
No. Unlike many home buying companies or real estate agents, Express Homebuyers never charges a fee.
How long do I have to decide once you make an offer on my house?
Most of our offers have a 30 day expiration date. But in many cases, homeowners find our offers so attractive and fair they accept them immediately!
Do you buy condominiums?
Yes. Michael the Home Buyer will purchase a condo, town- house, duplex, farm, apartment house, vacation property, land – almost any piece of real estate.
I have a mortgage. Does it get paid off?
Yes. By law, any mortgage or other liens must be paid off when you sell the house. The balance of the money goes to you.
I am facing foreclosure. Can you still buy my house?
Yes, if we work quickly! Many lenders would prefer to receive payment on their mortgage loan instead of taking the property. Michael the Home Buyer often works with lenders to delay foreclosure until we can complete the home purchase and you have the money to pay off the mortgage and avoid foreclosure. If you live in Ontario and are within a certain period of time before your foreclosure sale date, we will introduce you to a Foreclosure Consultant.
How do you determine the amount you will pay for a house?
We take many factors into consideration, including: location of the home, age and condition of the property, any needed repairs, selling prices of similar homes, etc. We’ve been making real estate transactions for many years and have deep experience in determining the fair market value of a home.
My house needs several repairs. Does this mean you won’t buy it?
Not at all! Most of the houses we purchase are in need of repairs or updating. So long as the home is basically in good condition, we’ll buy it from you.
Where do you buy property?
We currently buy properties all over Ontario.
